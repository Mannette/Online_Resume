    <h2>History and Profile</h2>
    <p>I have extensive experience in swimming, dam building, and chewing wood. Most of my days are filled with swimming around in rivers, building dams, and chewing wood. My favorite activities are definitely swimming, building dams, and chewing wood. I currently hold the world record for most trees chewed down and served for the national chewing brigade. On the days where I'm not swimming, building dams, or chewing wood; I enjoy sleeping.</p>
